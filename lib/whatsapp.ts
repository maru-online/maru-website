 * WhatsApp — single source of truth for the number and the per-page openers.
 *
 * The number lived as a hardcoded `wa.me/…` literal in four places (the floating
 * widget, the footer, the contact page, and the contact auto-reply email), which
 * is how a number change turns into a bug hunt. It is now one constant, and the
 * openers are one table.
 *
 * Format: E.164 without the leading `+` and without the trunk `0` after the
 * country code — `27` + `678904113`, never `27` + `0678904113`. wa.me silently
 * fails on a malformed number rather than erroring, so this is worth stating.
